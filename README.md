#### Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
It was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.


### OOPs
OOPS is abbreviate as Object Oriented Programming system in which programs are considered as a collection of objects .Each object is an instance of a class .

1. Abstraction 
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritence 
4. Polymorphism 

### Class 
A class is a repersentation of a type of object. It is a blueprint / templet that describe the details of an object. 

#### Object 
An object is an instance of a class. It has its own state and behavior and identity .

### Abstraction
A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract. 
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is an attribute of an object , and contain all data which is hidden . That hidden data can be restricted to the member of that class .

Levels are - Public , Protected , Private , Internal and Protected Internal 

### Inheritence
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
Where one class share the structures and behavior defined another class . 
 
(a). Inheritance represents the <IS-A> relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

(b).If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation. Aggregation represents <HAS-A> relationship.


### Polymorphism 
Polymorphism  is assigning behavior or value in a subclass to something that was already declear in the main class . Simply , Polymorphism takes more than one forms .

## Method-Overloading is a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters.
## Method-Overriding  If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class
